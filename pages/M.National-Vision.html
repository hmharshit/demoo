      <h1>National Vision </h1>
      <div class="two_third first">
	  
		<p></p>
		
		
		<p>A firm belief in the ideal that a truly rich and diverse nation like India is optimally united when its people give precedence to their identity
		as ‘Indians before everything else’ is what led to the birth of the BJP. The party's staunch commitment to this principle is what has ensured its
		unparalleled rise to becoming one of the largest, most representative political parties in India.The BJP believes in true ‘National’ politics, 
		where every Indian, irrespective of his caste, creed or religion is an Indian first. It doesn’t believe in narrow politics of compartmentalisation
		and division of society. The party's agenda is to unite people on the basis of their love for the country. Primacy to this identity is what will 
		once again chart the path for India’s re-emergence as a cultural and economic superpower.This should also be looked at in light of BJP’s core 
		commitment to its guiding philosophy of ‘Integral Humanism’, which considers all Indians as one united entity. Our leadership has walked this 
		path for years and believes that it will ensure our precious energies aren’t wasted in petty differences. Keeping the interest of the nation 
		above everything else is what will ensure a united and powerful India, wherein each one of its 1.25 billion citizens contributes in his or her
		unique way, and fulfils his or her unique dream.</p>
	  
		<p>One of My Major Social Goal is to Work for Our Society for its Better Upliftment , Work to Make Middle and Lower Class People Uprise and
		Make the Society bit More Open to Equality . My Major Aim is to Provide Scope of Living a Good Lifestyle to the People in India by Providing
		them Jobs , Life Security and Other Neccecities . Social Working is a Trending Issue , Here in India . Still i Aim for a good Political Position 
		to Accomplish and Achieve These Goals, Other than Being a Social Worker Following the Footsteps of Shri. Narender D. Modi and Guidelines of
		Bharatiya Janta Party and Disciplines of Rashtriya SwayamSewa Sangh. </p>
